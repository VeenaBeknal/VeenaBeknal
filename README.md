### I an aspiring Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer with over 8+ years of experience in Software Development and Data Science. Currently, I am pursuing Master's in Data Analytics at San Jose State University. I am passionate about __Machine Learning__, __DataScinece__ and __Data Engineering__ as it involves continuous learning and I believe these are the skills essential to understand and navigate an increasingly data-rich world. Transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, optimizing process and innovating solutions will be the future in the data world. I'm a lifelong learner, and I constantly update my knowledge of the rapidly evolving data science landscape.!

<h2> About my projects </h2>

<h3 align = "center">  Supervised Machine Learning Projects </h3> 

<a href="https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/DiabetesPrediction">Diabetes Prediction</a>

<h4> https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/DiabetesPrediction <h4>

##### This repository contains machine learning project for predicting diabetes in Pima Indian women. This is dataset available on Kaggle which is based on Pima Indian also refered as "River People" as they are prone to type-2 diabetes due to serveral historical and sociological factors. Machine learning models mainly tree-based models such as Decision tree, Random forest, Gradiant Boost machine and XGBoost were performed in predicting the type-2 diabetes.


<h4> https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/Predicting-Amazon-Product-Review-Helpfulness <h4>

##### This repository contains machine learning project for predicting helpfulness of Amazon Product Reviews. This dataset used is a subset of the ‚ÄúAmazon Review Data (2018)‚Äù published by Ni (2018), UCSD. Focused categories for this project are appliances, automotive, cell phones and accessories, and tools and home improvement. Multiple classification machine learning models such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine and tree-based models such as Random Forest and XGBoost were performed.


<h4> https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/Solar-Irradiance-to-Sustainably-Power-Streetlights <h4>

##### This repository contains machine learning project for predicting Solar Irradiance to sustainably power the streetlights. The dataset was extracted National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and data collected from NSRDB which contained detailed solar irradiance data for selected zip codes across San Jose, California. Various Regression machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Tree-based models such as Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regression and Regularization regression such as L1 and L2 were performed.

<h3 align = "center">  Unsupervised Machine Learning Projects </h3> 

<h4> https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/USClimatologicalDataAnalysis <h4>

##### This repository contains machine learning project for predicting predicting weather patterns, studying climate change, and understanding local weather conditions. The dataset was extracted FTP server of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Data for california weather stations was extracted. There are three main use case for this project Use case 1: Difference between temperature over the years. Use case 2: Distribution of temperature and Use case 3: Extreme weather data clustering for California stations. For usecase 3 unsupervised machine learning such as K-means was performed.


<h3 align = "center">  Database Projects (SQL and NoSQL) </h3> 

<h4> https://github.com/VeenaBeknal/LinkedInJobPostings <h4>

##### This repository contains project build on SQL and NoSQL database systems for LinkedIn Job Posting. Analysis of various job posting listed on LinkedIn from the dataset from Kaggle. After the data is preprocessed and cleaned two different solution for the database were created for SQL using MySQL and NoSQL using MongoDB.
